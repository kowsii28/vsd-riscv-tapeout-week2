ðŸ“˜ Week 2 â€” SoC Fundamentals & BabySoC
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand what a System-on-Chip (SoC) is and why it is used.

Identify core components of a typical SoC.

Learn about BabySoC, a minimalist learning platform.

Explore functional modelling and its role in RTL design.

Gain hands-on experience with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation.

ðŸ“– Theory / Background
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

An SoC integrates a complete computing platform onto a single silicon die, combining:

Processing, memory, and peripherals

Bus/interconnect for internal communication

Power, clock, and reset management

Aspect	Description
Heterogeneous blocks	CPU core(s), memory subsystems, programmable logic, analog IP, peripherals (UART, SPI, GPIO, timers, etc.)
On-chip interconnect	Bus or Network-on-Chip (NoC) for low-latency data routing
Design hierarchy	Specification â†’ Functional Model â†’ RTL â†’ Gate-level â†’ Physical layout
Why SoC?	Reduces BOM cost, improves performance & power, shortens time-to-market, enables compact devices
ðŸ”¹ 2. Core Components of a Typical SoC
Block	Primary Role	Typical Example
CPU / Processor Core	Executes software and general-purpose compute	ARM Cortex-M0, RISC-V RV32IMC
Memory Subsystem	Stores program code, data, temporary results	SRAM, ROM, Flash, Cache, External DDR
Peripherals	Interface to external devices or internal functions	UART, SPI, IÂ²C, GPIO, Timers, PWM, ADC/DAC
Interconnect / Bus	Routes transactions between masters & slaves	AHB/APB, Wishbone, TileLink, AXI
Debug & Trace	Inspect internal state during software development	JTAG, ETM, Serial-Wire Debug
Power Management	Clock gating, voltage scaling, power islands	PMU, DVFS controller
Reset & Clock	Stable timing and deterministic startup	PLLs, clock dividers, reset synchronizers

ðŸ’¡ Note: CPU typically sits at the center, connected via interconnect to memory and peripherals. High-performance memory uses fast buses; low-power I/O uses simpler buses.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Why BabySoC? â€“ A Minimalist Learning Platform
Aspect	BabySoC	Typical Commercial SoC
Complexity	<10k LOC; a handful of modules (simple CPU FSM, RAM, UART, timer, bus)	Hundreds of IP blocks; millions of RTL lines
Visibility	All signals visible in GTKWave	Many nets hidden or optimized
Tool-chain	Open-source simulation (Icarus Verilog)	Often requires commercial tools
Learning focus	Functional modelling, understanding block behavior	RTL optimization, timing closure, floor-planning
Extensibility	Adding peripherals or tweaking bus requires few Verilog files	Adding features needs deep architectural changes

Key Benefits for Students:

Architectural Insight: Observe CPU â†” bus â†” memory â†” peripherals in real-time.

Rapid Prototyping: Test benches run quickly with Icarus Verilog.

Verification Foundations: Stimulus generators, checkers, and coverage models are reusable.

ðŸ”¹ 4. The Role of Functional Modelling
Design Stage	Goal	Typical Artefacts
Specification	Define features, performance, I/O	Requirement docs, block diagrams, use-cases
Functional Modelling	Validate behavior at high level before RTL	Behavioral Verilog/SystemVerilog modules, testbenches, stimulus scripts
RTL Design	Convert functional description into synthesizable hardware	Clock-edge triggered RTL, FSMs, datapaths
Synthesis & Physical	Map RTL to gates, place & route	Gate-level netlist, floorplan, timing reports
Post-silicon	Verify silicon matches spec	Silicon bring-up, hardware debug, firmware validation

Why Functional Modelling Matters:

Fast Feedback: Runs faster than RTL simulation; exposes architectural mismatches early.

Architecture Exploration: Experiment with bus topologies, memory sizes, or peripheral protocols.

Verification Scaffolding: Testbenches can be reused for later RTL verification.

BabySoC Workflow:

Each block described behaviorally (e.g., UART echoes received bytes).

Concise Verilog testbenches drive simulation.

Signals observed in GTKWave.

Verified behavioral modules refined into synthesizable RTL.

ðŸ“Š Summary

SoC integrates compute, memory, peripherals, and interconnect on a single die.

Core components: CPU, memory hierarchy, peripherals, bus, debug, power, clock/reset.

BabySoC mirrors essential SoC blocks in a small, open-source framework.

Functional modelling bridges high-level specification and RTL, enabling rapid validation and reusable verification frameworks.

Hands-on BabySoC simulation with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave provides foundational SoC design and verification experience.
